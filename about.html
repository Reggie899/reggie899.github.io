          <p id="p">Hello there! This is me. My journey as a web developer started at the
          beginning of 2020 when a friend of mine suggested I start learning how
          to create my own apps and projects after I kept telling him what I
          would change on different apps and websites... pretty much all the
          time. I am sure he just didnâ€™t want to listen to my rants anymore.
          This kicked off a series of events and now I am here and you are
          reading this. That is the best example of how a thought becomes action
          and changes your life. <br/><br/> Before becoming a web developer I got a degree
          in Sociology and worked in different roles in the social and cultural
          exchange field. I started out as an assistant, then moved on to being
          a coordinator and team lead to later becoming a counselor. It has been
          a great adventure that has equipped me with a lot of experience and
          trained me to see the big picture. I kicked off my web development
          journey by learning about different online training programs and
          decided to start learning coding with
          <span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.shecodes.io/">SheCodes</a></span>.
          Quickly, I was captivated by all the things I was able to do and to
          create and decided to enter the web development program of the
         <span> <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/courses/web-development/"
            >DCI</a
          ></span>
          that teaches web development in depth and qualified me to become a
          full stack developer. This is where I am currently enrolled until
          December 2022. 
          <br/><br/>
          I am striving to create fun and interactive
          exerperiences for the user through websites and apps. These
          experiences can be heartwarming inspiring, exciting, dreamy, ...you
          name it. If you are looking for exactly that, feel welcome to
          <span class="contact"
            ><a target="_blank" href="./contact.html">contact me</a></span
          >. We will come up with an individual concept for you and make it
          happen. I am looking forward to working with you.
